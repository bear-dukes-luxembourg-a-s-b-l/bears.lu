## Bear Dukes Luxembourg

We are the Luxembourgish bear community ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º:bear:.
We started as a bunch of people (actually 2 mains and some other gravitating around them) that want to make the bear scene in Luxembourg being more visible, living, active, seen, sane. We did organize the first bear pride in Luxembourg in 2016, organizing the second one in 2017 and running the 3rd Mr. Bear Election for the first year.

Since November 2017 we are also a non-profit organisation registered at [RCSL](http://www.rcsl.lu/) working to give more visibility to our community and act for their rights (to keep it simple). If you are a lawyer, you may :heart: [reading our status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRoX50PTnVKSxIS28eYIxhZE6_6iZbqMtLe41F3mbSbrhepcglcp11tRn5Czc2tT_34KWe47AI-Dmgl/pub).

## Social media

We are not on a lot of social media, by choice and lack of time, but we are pretty active on Facebook. With an official "fanpage" who give general information about the LGBT+ & bear community, reposting news from our neighbourgs also, and a private group where all the community member can express himself & where we post pictures of the parties (to respect people privacy, this group is limited to men-only people that expressed interest in bear communities before).
