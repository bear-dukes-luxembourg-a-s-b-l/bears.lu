**Queer Art Festival** is happening during the Luxembourg Pride 2022! From 1st to 3rd of July, queer artists from Greater Region and All Europe will be able to showcase their art, thanks to the work of [Rosa Letzebuerg](http://www.rosaletzebuerg.lu/ "Rosa Letzebuerg") 🏳️‍🌈 

If you're a queer artist or an artist who want to showcase your art on queer related topic, you can go on the official website and [apply to take part of the festival](https://queerarts.lu/take-part/).

It's not limited to performance or painting or photography. You can also enter with music 🎻 🎼, poetry, slam 🎤, or writing 📖.
