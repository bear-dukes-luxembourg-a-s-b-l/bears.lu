The European MSM Internet Survey (EMIS) is back for 2024, and we need your help to make a difference! This important survey is designed to collect valuable data from gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) across Europe. Your participation can help shape the future of sexual health services and policies, ensuring they are tailored to meet the needs of our community.

## What is EMIS-2024?

EMIS-2024 is a comprehensive, anonymous online survey that aims to gather insights from MSM individuals about their sexual health, behaviors, and needs. This survey is part of a larger project that has been conducted previously in 2010 and 2017, with the goal of informing better health interventions and services across Europe. The data collected from EMIS-2024 will be used to understand the differences in sexual health needs among various groups and to identify risk and precautionary behaviors.

## Why Should You Participate?

1. **Your Voice, Our Strength**: By participating in EMIS-2024, you contribute to a greater understanding of the sexual health needs of MSM across Europe. This information is crucial for developing effective health services and interventions.
2. **Confidential and Anonymous**: Your privacy is our priority. The survey is entirely anonymous, ensuring that your responses cannot be traced back to you.
3. **Influence Change**: The results from EMIS have historically influenced public health policies and services, leading to better support and resources for our community.
