In Europe and worldwide, cases of monkeypox have been reported in recent weeks.

Although the Ministry of Health reports that there are currently (as of 21/05/2022) no suspected or confirmed cases of monkeypox in Luxembourg, it is important to raise awareness of its spread.

## What is monkeypox?

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease, which is usually transmitted to humans in forested areas of Central and West Africa through contact with wild rodents or primates. It can also be transmitted between humans through close contact, but the risk is generally lower.

## How is it transmitted?

Monkeypox virus can be transmitted between humans by :

* direct contact with skin lesions or mucous membranes of a sick person,
* droplets (saliva, sneezes, sputum, etc.) in prolonged face-to-face contact,
* contact with objects in the direct environment of a sick person (bedding, towels, clothing). clothing).

The vast majority of current cases in Europe are probably due to transmission during sexual intercourse. The risk of transmission is increased by direct contact with rashes or

The risk of transmission is increased by direct contact with rashes or lesions on the anus or genitals. On the other hand, the virus is more easily spread among people who have sex with multiple partners.

## How to protect yourself?

Using a condom during sex can protect against many sexually transmitted infections and can also reduce the risk of transmission of the

monkeypox virus. However, it does not fully protect against infection in the latter case, as contact with a lesion may be sufficient to transmit the virus.

## Symptoms

Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, rash and blisters, itching, swollen lymph nodes, chills and fatigue.

## What to do if you have symptoms?

1. Contact the national infectious diseases service: 4, rue Ernest Barblé L-1210 Luxembourg. Tel: 4411-3091
2. Avoid sexual activity, close contact or sharing of objects and fabrics (clothing, bedding) until monkeypox has been ruled out or the infection has resolved (minimum 3 weeks).
