The Worldfetish Show Contest started in 2020 as a fun project to entertain a group of friends, who were depressed because of the pandemic. There were no professional movie crews to shoot the videos, just them and their mobile phones. 

But thanks to all the people, who worked behind this project, it became a huge success and this year we had more participants, from various countries. 

This year's edition have more than 40 artists for 25+ countries and not just European's ones. If you did the math, that means there's not just solo artists but groups, and also 5 countries have pre-selection, held last Saturday where the president of all the national jury votes for which candidate for each of those 5 countries they prefers based on their own critters. 

## Luxembourg in the contest

If Luxembourg doesn't compete for Eurovision since years thanks to the lack of enthusiasm from our government and broadcasters (even without speaking how the hell we would host when we win ðŸ˜…), we are part of the fetish version since the first edition.

Luxembourg entry for last year was _Tom(s) of Luxembourg_ and this year, **Paul** asked if he can participate and represent the Bears of Luxembourg to this fun event. Of course we agreed on this immediately.

ðŸ¥° We can't be more proud of him following the work of all the misters bear Luxembourg before him putting our tiny country on the international scene. 

## The 2021 Jury
