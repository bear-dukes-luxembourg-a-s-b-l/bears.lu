**Luxembourg, May 15, 2024** â€“ Bear Dukes Luxembourg, a dedicated community-focused organization serving the LGBTQ+ community, particularly gay and trans men, today announced a temporary hold on all upcoming nightlife events after October 2024. This decision comes after careful consideration of our event offerings in response to community needs and financial efficiency.

As a non-profit entity powered by the unwavering commitment of our volunteers, Bear Dukes Luxembourg has consistently prioritized hosting events that are meaningful and sustainable. Our assessments show that the current offerings sufficiently meet the demands of our community. Given our duty to manage resources prudently, we will pause these events to reallocate efforts towards other impactful initiatives.

However, all currently scheduled events will proceed as planned. These include:

- May 19, 2024: WR Heroes
- June 7, 2024: GANG BANG
- June 13, 2024: WR Pride
- October 9-13, 2024: Bear Pride events
- Monthly Bear Afterworks

We extend our deepest gratitude to our event teams, who are eager to continue their involvement in our future activities. Their dedication has been instrumental in fostering an inclusive, vibrant community atmosphere.

Bear Dukes Luxembourg wishes the best to other nightlife event organizers. We encourage all community efforts to enhance the collective value and support meaningful social causes.
