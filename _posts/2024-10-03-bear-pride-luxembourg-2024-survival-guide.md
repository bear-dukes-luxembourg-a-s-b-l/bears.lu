Bear Pride 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting event, building on the success of previous years. As an annual celebration organized by Bear Dukes Luxembourg a.s.b.l., it's a weekend that brings together Gay Bears (gay men and trans men) from all over Europe. With an expected attendance of around 250 people, it's a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community, enjoy various events, and celebrate diversity.

Let's dive into the essentials you need to know to make your Bear Pride 2024 experience truly unforgettable!
