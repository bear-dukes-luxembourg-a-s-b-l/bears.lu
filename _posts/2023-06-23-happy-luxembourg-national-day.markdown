As we lift our rainbow-colored flags alongside the red, white, and light blue of our beloved Grand Duchy, we at Bear Dukes Luxembourg are thrilled to wish you all a joyful and meaningful Luxembourg National Day! This day marks not only the commemoration of our Grand Duke's anniversary, but it also serves as a vibrant celebration of the unity, tradition, and diversity that are intricately woven into the fabric of our nation.

Luxembourg's history is rich, its heritage is colorful, and its spirit is indomitable. In the heart of Europe, our small nation stands out for its big heart and its welcoming nature. At Bear Dukes Luxembourg, we are proud to be part of this open, multicultural society, as we continuously work towards fostering a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for LGBTQ+ individuals, specifically those identifying as bears within Luxembourg and the Greater Region.

Today, as we celebrate our Grand Duke and our shared heritage, we would also like to take a moment to honor you - the members of our vibrant community, our allies, and our friends. We celebrate your courage, your authenticity, and your relentless pursuit of love and acceptance. Each one of you adds a unique thread to the beautiful tapestry of our community, strengthening it and making it more vibrant. You are the driving force that allows us to create a future that is increasingly inclusive, diverse, and just.

Our unity on this day is not only about rejoicing in our shared Luxembourgish identity but also about standing strong for the LGBTQ+ rights we all hold dear. It's about acknowledging our past struggles, celebrating our victories, and gearing up for future challenges. The strides we've made in advocating for and securing LGBTQ+ rights are worth celebrating, and this National Day, we celebrate those strides as part of our Luxembourgish identity.

On this special occasion, let us come together as one community, proudly bear our colors, and stand tall in our identities. Let us spread the message of love, acceptance, and unity. Because, in the end, love is love, regardless of who we are or whom we love. And this love is something worth celebrating every day, not just on Luxembourg National Day.

From everyone at Bear Dukes Luxembourg, we wish you a Luxembourg National Day filled with joy, unity, love, and pride. Let's continue to stand together, shine together, and most importantly, be proud together.

Happy National Day!
