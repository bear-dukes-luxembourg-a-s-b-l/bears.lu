\#COVID19 forced us to reinvent this event in something smaller, focus on the local community, and our direct neighbor instead of a truly international event. But Luxembourg isn’t already international after all?

This year, we'll do then only smaller events:

1. [OctoBEARFest](https://www.facebook.com/events/672328533407898) on Friday at Bar Rouge. It's **mandatory** to [reserve your seat here](https://tickets.out.lu/e/5/octobearfest).
2. [Diner spectacle](https://www.facebook.com/events/778314932999822) with a bearbecue at Knokke Out on Saturday. [Reservation is also **mandatory**](https://tickets.out.lu/e/4/bear-pride-2020-diner-spectacle) since we need to put the table and order food and everything a few days before. You have until Monday the 12th.
3. A brunch, probably at Mama Shelter or any nice place doing brunch in Luxembourg-city. We're still trying to figure it out so, please, [RSVP here](https://thibault.typeform.com/to/aCoySXkI) if you're interested. 

The menu for the Diner spectacle is just below ⤵️
