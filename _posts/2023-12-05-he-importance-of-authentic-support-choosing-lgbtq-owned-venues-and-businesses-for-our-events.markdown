In the vibrant tapestry of LGBTQ+ events, parties, and gatherings, there's an often overlooked but critical aspect that deserves our attention: the ownership and management of the venues where these events are held. It's increasingly common to find LGBTQ+ parties being hosted at venues run by individuals who don't identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. While inclusivity is a cornerstone of our community, it's essential to scrutinize the intentions and involvement of these venue owners in LGBTQ+ rights and issues.

### The Challenge with Non-LGBTQ+ Run Venues

One of the main issues with LGBTQ+ events at venues run by straight individuals with no active interest in LGBTQ+ rights is the lack of genuine understanding and connection to the community. These venues might see LGBTQ+ events merely as profitable opportunities rather than a part of a significant cultural and social movement. This perspective can lead to a lack of sensitivity towards the unique needs and concerns of the LGBTQ+ community, potentially resulting in an environment that feels inauthentic or even unwelcoming.

Furthermore, when profits from these events don't circulate back into LGBTQ+ initiatives or causes, it represents a missed opportunity to support the community in a more meaningful way.

### Why Supporting LGBTQ+ Owned Businesses and Non-Profits Matters

#### **1. Authentic Representation and Understanding**

LGBTQ+ owned businesses and non-profits inherently understand the nuances and dynamics of our community. They are more likely to create spaces that are not only safe but also resonant with the values and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals. This understanding fosters a sense of belonging and validation that is hard to replicate in non-LGBTQ+ run spaces.

#### **2. Economic Empowerment**

Supporting LGBTQ+ owned businesses and non-profits translates to economic empowerment for the community. It ensures that the financial benefits of LGBTQ+ events are reinvested in initiatives that directly support LGBTQ+ rights, health, and wellbeing.

#### **3. Advocacy and Visibility**

LGBTQ+ owned businesses often serve as advocates for the community. They play a crucial role in raising awareness about LGBTQ+ issues, promoting visibility, and fostering a sense of community solidarity. By choosing these businesses, we amplify their voice and impact.

#### **4. Creating Safe and Inclusive Spaces**

LGBTQ+ owners are more likely to prioritize creating spaces that are inclusive and safe for all members of the community, including those who are often marginalized within the community, such as trans and non-binary individuals.

### How to Support LGBTQ+ Owned Businesses and Non-Profits

* **Research and Choose Wisely:** When planning or choosing to attends an event, research to find LGBTQ+ owned options. Websites, social media groups, and community networks are great resources.
* **Spread the Word:** Use your social media or word-of-mouth to promote LGBTQ+ owned businesses and events.
* **Engage with LGBTQ+ Non-Profits:** Attend their events, donate, or volunteer. Your involvement can make a significant difference.
* **Feedback and Collaboration:** Provide constructive feedback to these businesses and explore collaboration opportunities. It's about building a supportive community together.

In conclusion, while inclusivity means welcoming support from allies, it is equally vital to ensure that our choices in venues and businesses align with the values of authenticity, support, and empowerment of the LGBTQ+ community. Let's make our celebrations not just a party, but a statement of solidarity, support, and pride in who we are and what we stand for.
