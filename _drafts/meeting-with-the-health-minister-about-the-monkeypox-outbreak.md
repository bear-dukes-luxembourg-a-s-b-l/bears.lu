We were very pleased to be invited to discuss with the [MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© Luxembourg](https://www.facebook.com/sante.lu) about the **#monkeypox** and provide feedback we got from you and our own collective experience regarding this new disease and after working with [DIMPS-Project](https://www.facebook.com/HIVBerodung.dimps/), [Croix-Rouge luxembourgeoise](https://www.facebook.com/crlux/), [Centre Lgbtiq+ Cigale](https://www.facebook.com/CentreCIGALE/), [Rosa LÃ«tzebuerg](https://www.facebook.com/rosa.letzebuerg/) and many other partners on the question of the LGBTQ+ health in Luxembourg.

Already 400+ people got vaccinated and 1000 appointments are still to be handled. More vaccines are arriving and the new vaccination protocol helps to be able to treat more people ðŸ˜Œ

Improvements were discussed such as providing up-to-date information in more languages and ease up the pre-vaccination medical appointment for people who are not already followed by the CHL - Centre des maladies infectieuses.

You can get all the info, mostly in french for now, on [http://monkeypox.lu/](https://monkeypox.lu/ "https://monkeypox.lu/") but you can use thoses links to get Google translate version of it :
