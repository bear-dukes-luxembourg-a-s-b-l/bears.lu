    <p>Few reason can explain the error:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>You cancelled the payment during the 3D Secure-ish procedure. So the payment was automatically cancelled. You'll have to retry your payment manually.</li>
      <li>You decided to abord the payment. If so, we'll be glad to <a href="/contact" title="Heads to the contact page">know why</a>.</li>
      <li>Your card was declined by the bank. That happen sometimes also when your bank think it's not a usual kind of transaction. It doesn't mean necessarly you don't have enought fund on your account.</li>
    </ul>
