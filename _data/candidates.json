    "age": "38",
    "about": "Hi, I’m Yannick, 38, a chub/bear from the south of Luxembourg. I’m a Graphic Designer, Podcaster, and Movie Buff. I enjoy good food, quality time on the couch, and I love the Luxembourgish lifestyle.",
    "motivation": "I want to be Mister Bear to show that everything is possible. Many people don’t see themselves fitting into a niche or group, and I want them to know that it’s okay to be different. I know what it’s like to feel alone and unseen, but the bear community changed that for me with its open arms. Now I want to show others that even when they feel alone, there’s always a community ready to welcome and support them.",
