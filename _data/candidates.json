    "age": "38",
    "about": "Hi, I’m Yannick, 38, a chub/bear from the south of Luxembourg. I’m a Graphic Designer, Podcaster, and Movie Buff. I enjoy good food, quality time on the couch, and I love the Luxembourgish lifestyle.",
    "motivation": "I want to be Mister Bear to show that everything is possible. Many people don’t see themselves fitting into a niche or group, and I want them to know that it’s okay to be different. I know what it’s like to feel alone and unseen, but the bear community changed that for me with its open arms. Now I want to show others that even when they feel alone, there’s always a community ready to welcome and support them.",

    "about": "Since my candidacy last year, I am now working in the meantime for a trade union and I’m also involved in several committees, where I also actively advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community \n 🏳️‍🌈My hobbies include drawing, gaming (though my other commitments unfortunately don’t always leave me as much time for it as I’d like🥲🎮), spending time in nature (hence my tattoos 🍃😏), and enjoying time with friends. And as Olaf would say; I love warm hugs 😉",
    "motivation": "For the same reason as last year: since my coming out, the Bear Community has welcomed me. I have been an active member for almost 10 years, and through the events that have been organized over the years, I can clearly see the potential and promise of our community here in Luxembourg and want to help further improve it. 💪\nI want to give something back to the Bear Community, strengthen our international connections, create new events that everyone can enjoy, and fully embrace life as Bears together. 🐻",
