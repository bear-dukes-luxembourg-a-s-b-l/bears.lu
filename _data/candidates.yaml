   Miguel Ange, 39 y.o. 🇪🇸Spanish born in 🇱🇺Luxembourg. Lived 20 years in LUX
   before going back for 12 years in Spain before the economic crisis. Back in
   Luxembourg for 7 years now, working as gardening assistant. He loves
   🌱nature, landscape, going out with friends, a good restaurant. He's a soft
   teddy bear who loves cuddling with other bears.
   <br/><br/>
   He wants to be Mr. Bear to get involve in the community, making activities,
   parties, charity events,... He wants to represent the bears to have a better
   place in the LGBT scene. He thinks the title will help him to be more
   confident and open to the world.

   He's 32, from 🇱🇺Bascharage and a 🕺professional dancer and choregrapher
   which leads him to travel 🌍 all around the world. 🙊 He's super shy at
   first but when you start talking with him, he has this nice voice and you
   can see he's truly passionate about his work.
   <br/><br/>
   We wish this adventure will help him to open himself more with the community
   and all of you 🙂

   He's 47 and 💛 life. Open and communicative, he loves meeting new people,
   especially with a good drink. And he loves to laugh. Life is too short to be
   serious all the time 😉
   <br/><br/>
   He's working with young people with special needs to help them finding their
   way in life. He loves 👨‍🎤 to sing and do it solo or in a choir, especially in
   in Choeur de Chambre de Luxembourg & Reebou Sänger. He's fit and hits the
   gym 💪🏼 to keep healthy.
   <br/><br/>
   He was at previous elections of Mr bear Luxembourg and told himself it could
   be fun to be on stage with other bears doing all of this journey with them.
   Because, for him, it's this shared adventure which matter. But he's also
   more than ready to bring the title in 🇱🇺Luxembourg and 🇪🇺European events
   with fierce and honor.

   Jérome is 39, 🇫🇷 french livning in 🇱🇺Luxembourg for 8 years now and in a
   happy relationship for the same amount of time. He's working at 🍕Pizzahut
   as Shift leader.
   <br/><br/>
   It took him a long time to realize he's part of the big bear family but he's
   now at ease with it and decided to run for the title before getting 40 😂
   (and because 2020 is 20+20=40 ... that must be a sign 🤔).
