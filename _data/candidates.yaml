  about: "Jérome is 39, \U0001F1EB\U0001F1F7 french livning in \U0001F1F1\U0001F1FALuxembourg
    for 8 years now and in a happy relationship for the same amount of time. He's
    working at \U0001F355Pizzahut as Shift leader. <br/><br/> It took him a long time
    to realize he's part of the big bear family but he's now at ease with it and decided
    to run for the title before getting 40 \U0001F602 (and because 2020 is 20+20=40
    ... that must be a sign \U0001F914)."
